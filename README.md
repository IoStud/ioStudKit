## How to install the package in your project

You can add **IoStudKit** to your Swift project either in Xcode or via the Swift Package Manager in Visual Studio Code. Steps may vary slightly depending on your IDE version.

### Xcode

1. In the menu bar, select **File > Add Packagesâ€¦**  
2. Paste the repository URL: **https://github.com/IoStud/ioStudKit**  
3. Choose the version requirement and target project.  
4. Click **Add Package**.  
5. In your Swift files, import the module:

   ```swift
   import IoStudkit
   ```

### Other IDEs (Swift Package Manager)

1. Edit your **Package.swift** to include **IoStudKit** as a dependency:

   ```swift
   import PackageDescription

   let package = Package(
       name: "YourProject",
       dependencies: [
           .package(url: "https://github.com/IoStud/ioStudKit", from: "1.0.0")
       ],
       targets: [
           .target(
               name: "YourProject",
               dependencies: ["ioStudKit"]
           )
       ]
   )
   ```
3. Build your project:  
   ```bash
   swift build
   ```

## How to use it

All functionalities are accessible through a single **IoStud** instance by calling the corresponding methods. First, create your IoStud client with your **student ID** and **password**. The library handles login and token refresh automatically.

```swift
let ioStud = IoStud(studentID: "12345678", studentPwd: "yourPassword")
```

Below are common usage examples:

### Retrieve Student Profile

```swift
if let bio = try await ioStud.retrieveStudentBio() {
   print(bio.name, bio.institutionalEmail, bio.academicYearOfCourse)
} else {
   print("Error while fetching student bio")
}
```

### Fetch Completed Exams

```swift
if let doneExams = await ioStud.retrieveDoneExams() {
    for exam in doneExams {
        print("Course:", exam.courseName)
        print("Grade:", exam.grade)
        print("Date:", exam.date)
        print("-----")
    }
} else {
    print("Error while fetching completed exams")
}
```
